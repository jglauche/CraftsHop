# CraftsHop

An open source, federated platform to promote hand crafted items.

### Motivation

To create a minority-inclusive online store platform that can be linked together to provide further reach.

### Status
Planning

### Ideas

For service providers:
- A service provider will run a platform and can open it up for artists to sign up and offer their products.
- connect to a public list of instances, be seen in other instances, see other instances.
- can block certain instances

For artists:
- Sign up to an instance, offer products
- Move to another instance(?) [think about: how to remove duplication?]

Users:
- can sign up to instances [think about: Can ordering be done from remote instances, is this feasable in legal contexts?]
- can copy account to other instances [think about: is it feasable to have it updated?]
- can (easily) propose to add other instances to the service provider

### Challenges
- with copying (especially user) data to other instances and keeping it up to date, this opens a pot of gold for data collectors
- How to keep track of bad / fake sellers and make sure they get depublished from the network?
- How to keep the network resillient to spam?
- How to provide and handle the needs for service providers in different legal juristictions?
